Hi! My name is Rouke Broersma. I'm a platform engineer and open source enthousiast.

My day-to-day involves delivering production ready managed cloud platforms to customers at [Info Support](https://infosupport.com). 
In my free time I work on [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io) and my [Homelab](https://github.com/broersma-forslund/homelab).

My main focus area is infrastructure automation.
