      <description>WSL does not play nice with VPN&amp;rsquo;s and you likely won&amp;rsquo;t realize this is the problem at first. Luckily the problem is usually easy to fix. Changing the MTU value of your WSL network adapter is a good start if you&amp;rsquo;re having issues!</description>

      <description>When you access Windows files from WSL there is a large price to pay. But if you have important or a lot of data you use in WSL it can be a problem to only use the WSL root filesystem you get by default. It lives only in WSL (with an awkward way to access it from Windows) and to me feels like temporary storage you could lose at any time. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great if you could use an external or extra hard disk in WSL while not having to pay the price? Well, now you can!</description>

      <title>Why I chose Hugo</title>

      <description>This blog is currently powered by Hugo, a static site generator built in Go. However this was not my first choice. Initially I was going to use Jekyll for the simple reason that I had heard of it before and it is what Github uses to power Github Pages.
Almost immediately I decided that while Jekyll seems fine to use I did not want to be limited to what Github natively offers, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to.</description>
